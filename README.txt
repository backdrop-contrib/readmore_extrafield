INTRODUCTION
------------

The Read More Extra Field module replaces the default "Read more" link
displayed when nodes are rendered as teasers by an extra field.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

 * The Field core module is required.


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.
   See: https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
   for further information.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

 * Visit admin/config/readmore_extrafield to enable the Read More Extra Field
   on specific entities. Any fieldable entity can be configured separately.

 * Configure the display of your entities to make the Read More link visible
   or hidden on any available view mode.
