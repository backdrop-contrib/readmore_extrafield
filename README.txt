INTRODUCTION
------------

The Read More Extra Field module replaces the default "Read more" link
(displayed when nodes are rendered as teasers) by an extra field.

This module brings the following advantages :

 * Fields appearance order is easily configurable via the display settings.
   It is thus easy to move the Read more link before or after any other field
   of your entities.

 * The Read More extra field is not intrusive. It can be enabled on any
   fieldable entity of your choice, and you can decide to keep the default
   Read More link.

 * The default Read More link only appear in Teaser mode. It can be annoying
   when you create custom view modes. The Read More Extra Field is available
   in all view modes.

 * The Read More Extra Field module comes with some additional useful
   settings : It is possible to configure the Read More link text, or add CSS
   classes.

 * This module can also be used to easily hide the default Read More link when
   it is not needed.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

 * The Field core module is required.


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.
   See: https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
   for further information.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

 * Visit admin/config/readmore_extrafield to enable the Read More Extra Field
   on specific entities. Any fieldable entity can be configured separately.

 * Configure the display of your entities to make the Read More link visible
   or hidden on any available view mode.
